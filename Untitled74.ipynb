    "Q1: Different clustering algorithms include K-means, hierarchical, DBSCAN, and Gaussian Mixture Models. \n",

    "Q2: K-means clustering partitions data into k clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster. \n",
    "It iteratively assigns points to clusters and updates cluster centroids until convergence.\n",
